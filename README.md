JAVID is an open-source graphic design and image-processing Grasshopper plug-in, developed in the ‘Coding for architects’ workshop at IAC. It can represent Images using different graphical techniques, such as ‘ASCII Art’, ‘String Art’ and many others.
JAVID introduces a new parameter called ‘Bitmap’ based on the standard ‘System.Drawing.Bitmap’, enabling it to work alongside plug-ins like Bitmap+.
JAVID is currently being developed, and further components are planned to be added in future updates. It is written in C# as a gha file and works with Grasshopper for Rhino 6 and Rhino 7.
