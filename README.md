JAVID is an open-source graphic design and image-processing Grasshopper plug-in, developed in the ‘Coding for architects’ workshop at Tehran. It can represent Images using different graphical techniques, such as [ASCII Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art), [String Art](http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/knit.html) and many others.
JAVID introduces a new parameter called ‘Bitmap’ based on the standard [System.Drawing.Bitmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.bitmap?view=netframework-4.8), enabling it to work alongside plug-ins like [Bitmap+](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/bitmap).
JAVID is currently being developed, and further components are planned to be added in future updates. It is written in C# as a gha file and works with Grasshopper for Rhino 6 and Rhino 7.
